# Question
Can you give some online courses provided by fast.ai?

# Answer
Fast.ai offers several high-quality, free online courses focused on deep learning and machine learning, designed to be accessible yet rigorous, with a practical, top-down teaching approach. Here’s a rundown of some key courses they provide, based on their current offerings as of March 10, 2025:

## 1. Practical Deep Learning for Coders
- **Overview**: This is fast.ai’s flagship course, aimed at people with at least one year of coding experience (no advanced math required). It teaches you how to build state-of-the-art models in areas like computer vision, natural language processing (NLP), tabular data analysis, and recommendation systems. The course emphasizes hands-on coding over theoretical lectures, using the `fastai` library and `PyTorch`.
- **Structure**: The latest version (as of 2022, with updates reflected in their ongoing work) includes about 36 hours of video lessons spread over multiple weeks. It’s paired with the book *Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch*, which you can read online for free as Jupyter notebooks or purchase in print.
- **Key Topics**: Building image classifiers, NLP models, deployment of web apps, and ethics in machine learning.
- **Access**: Available at [course.fast.ai](https://course.fast.ai). You’ll find video lessons, notebooks, and a forum for support.

## 2. Deep Learning Foundations to Stable Diffusion
- **Overview**: A more advanced course that dives deeper into the underpinnings of deep learning, culminating in building a Stable Diffusion model from scratch. It’s designed for those who’ve completed *Practical Deep Learning for Coders* or have equivalent experience.
- **Structure**: Launched in October 2022, it includes over 30 hours of video content. It’s less beginner-focused, peeling back the layers of `fastai` to explore lower-level concepts.
- **Key Topics**: Neural network foundations, optimization techniques, and generative AI (like Stable Diffusion).
- **Access**: Also hosted at [course.fast.ai](https://course.fast.ai), with accompanying Jupyter notebooks.

## 3. Introduction to Machine Learning for Coders
- **Overview**: This course targets coders who want a broader intro to machine learning (not just deep learning). It covers essential ML models, data preparation, and validation techniques, taught by Jeremy Howard at the University of San Francisco.
- **Structure**: Around 24 hours of lessons, designed for a 12-week pace (8 hours/week). It assumes basic coding skills and high-school-level math.
- **Key Topics**: Decision trees, random forests, logistic regression, and practical ML workflows.
- **Access**: Available via fast.ai’s course archives (check [course.fast.ai](https://course.fast.ai) or fast.ai’s GitHub).

## 4. Computational Linear Algebra for Coders
- **Overview**: A free course to equip learners with the linear algebra needed for machine learning, taught through coding rather than abstract theory. It’s a great companion for those wanting to strengthen their math foundations.
- **Structure**: Self-paced with Jupyter notebooks and video lessons, focusing on practical applications like matrix operations and SVD.
- **Key Topics**: Vectors, matrices, eigenvalues, and their use in ML algorithms.
- **Access**: Found at [course.fast.ai](https://course.fast.ai) or the fastai GitHub repo.

## 5. Cutting Edge Deep Learning for Coders (Part 2)
- **Overview**: An older but still valuable follow-up to *Practical Deep Learning for Coders*, focusing on advanced techniques and research-level topics. It’s less structured now but remains a resource for deeper exploration.
- **Structure**: Originally a 7-week course with about 20 hours of content, recorded in 2017.
- **Key Topics**: RNNs, CNN architectures, and building models from scratch.
- **Access**: Archived lessons are at [course18.fast.ai](https://course18.fast.ai) or fast.ai’s GitHub.

### How to Get Started
- Head to [course.fast.ai](https://course.fast.ai), where the latest versions of *Practical Deep Learning for Coders* and *Deep Learning Foundations to Stable Diffusion* are front and center. Older courses like *Introduction to Machine Learning* and *Computational Linear Algebra* are linked there or on fast.ai’s GitHub ([github.com/fastai/courses](https://github.com/fastai/courses)).
- You’ll need a computer with a GPU (or use cloud options like Colab) and basic Python knowledge. The courses use Jupyter notebooks, so familiarity with them helps but isn’t mandatory—they provide a tutorial.

These courses are all free, community-supported, and designed to get you building models fast while gradually revealing the “why” behind the code. Fast.ai’s philosophy is to democratize AI education, so they avoid gatekeeping with heavy prerequisites. Pick based on your level: start with *Practical Deep Learning* if you’re newish, or jump to *Foundations* if you’re ready for a deeper dive.
