# About Model Peformance Evaluation Metric  

Focusing on accuracy and precision is definitely important when conducting error analysis, but let's delve a bit deeper into what these terms mean and how they relate to your project:

### Accuracy  
This metric measures the overall correctness of your model's predictions. It is calculated as the ratio of correctly predicted instances (true positives and true negatives) to the total instances:  
`Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)`.  
While accuracy is a useful measure, it can be misleading, especially in cases of class imbalance. For example, if your model predicts the majority class well but fails to detect the minority class, the accuracy might still appear high.

### Precision  
Precision specifically measures the correctness of positive predictions. It is calculated as the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false positives:  
`Precision = TP / (TP + FP)`.  
High precision indicates that when your model predicts a class (e.g., a stop sign), it is likely correct. This is particularly important in your project because you want to minimize false positives, ensuring that the model does not incorrectly identify a sign when there isn't one.

### Recall  
While you mentioned accuracy and precision, it's also important to consider recall (or sensitivity), which measures the ability of the model to identify all relevant instances. It is calculated as the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives:  
`Recall = TP / (TP + FN)`.  
In your case, high recall would mean that the model successfully detects most of the actual road signs present in the images.

### F1 Score  
This is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric that balances both:  
`F1 Score = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)`.  
It can be particularly useful when you want to find a balance between precision and recall.
