# Strategies for Enhancing Model Recall

Each of your points addresses key factors that can significantly enhance the recall of your model. Letâ€™s break them down further:

## 1. Correct Labels of Objects

Ensuring that your dataset has accurate labels is fundamental. Mislabeling can lead to false negatives, as the model may learn incorrect associations. Regularly reviewing and cleaning your labeled data can help maintain high quality. You might also consider implementing a robust labeling process, possibly involving multiple reviewers or using semi-automated tools to assist in labeling.

## 2. Large Size of Dataset from Car Camera

A larger dataset can help the model generalize better and improve its ability to detect signs under various conditions. Collecting more images from the car's front-facing camera, especially in different environments and scenarios, will provide the model with a richer set of examples to learn from. This can include various times of day, weather conditions, and traffic situations.

## 3. Diverse Road Conditions

Including a variety of examples in your dataset is crucial for improving recall. This means capturing images of different types of road signs, traffic lights, and pedestrians in various contexts (e.g., urban vs. rural settings, day vs. night). The more diverse your training data, the better the model can learn to recognize signs in real-world situations.

## Additional Considerations

### Data Augmentation

In addition to collecting more data, you can use data augmentation techniques to artificially increase the size of your dataset. This can include rotating, flipping, or adding noise to images, which can help the model learn to recognize signs in different orientations and conditions.

### Error Analysis

After training your model, conducting error analysis can help you identify specific cases where the model is failing to detect signs. This can guide you in collecting more targeted data or adjusting your model.

### Transfer Learning

If you have access to pre-trained models, fine-tuning them on your specific dataset can leverage their learned features and improve recall.
